Please note that nilmtk cannot do this yet!  But we hope that it will do soon! This image is from the following paper and since the main author is contributing to nilmtk, so no permission issues.\r\n>Nipun Batra, Haimonti Dutta, Amarjeet Singh, “INDiC: Improved Non-Intrusive load monitoring using load Division and     Calibration”, to appear at the 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA’13) will be     held in Miami, Florida, USA, December 4 – December 7, 2013 \r\n    [Preprint](http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/icmla.pdf) [IPython notebook](http://www.iiitd.edu.in/~amarjeet/Research/indic.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75845627/misc/after_disagg.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 40% height: 40%;\"/>\r\n\r\n#####Current state of the project\r\n\r\nThe project is in the very, very earliest stages.  *It does not do anything useful yet!*  If you'd like to help design the architecture please jump into the [issue queue](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues).  Otherwise, if you want something usable, then please check back in a month or two ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Installing\r\n\r\nIf you just want to use the code without modifying it then:\r\n\r\n`python setup.py install`\r\n\r\n(you may have to run as `sudo`)\r\n\r\nIf you want to get involved in development then:\r\n\r\n`python setup.py develop`\r\n\r\n#####Software Dependencies\r\n\r\n1. Pandas\r\n2. matplotlib\r\n\r\n#####Further info\r\n\r\nPlease see [the nilmtk wiki](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/wiki) for more details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
